# Python Courses

I am currently taking two Python courses on **Udemy**:

* The Python Mega-Course: Build 10 Real-World Applications
* The Complete Python Course: Learn Python By Doing

# Python Projects

I have created some apps as part of the courses listed above. More information can be found in the respective **branches** associated with each app.

### The Python Mega-Course
* **English Dictionary**
  * Lets a user search the supplied **JSON** dictionary to check if a word exists or not

* **Web Map**
  * Creates a map that displays population and volcano data. Users have the choice to view as many layers (i.e. population, volcanoes) as they want
  
### The Complete Python Course
* **Book Storage System**

  * Allows users to:
    * Enter book details (i.e. title and author)
    * Retrieve the list of books they have saved
    * Mark a book as read
    * Delete a specific book
    
These operations are supported by a **MySQL** database.
