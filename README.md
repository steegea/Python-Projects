I am currently taking two Python courses on **Udemy**:

* The Complete Python Course: Learn Python By Doing

# Python Projects

I have created some apps as part of the courses listed above. More information can be found in the respective app **repositories**. The links are included below.

### The Python Mega-Course
* ![**English Dictionary**](https://github.com/steegea/English-Dictionary.git)
  * Lets a user search the supplied **JSON** dictionary to check if a word exists or not

* ![**Web Map**](https://github.com/steegea/Python-Web-Map.git)
  * Creates a map that displays population and volcano data. Users have the choice to view as many layers (i.e. population, volcanoes) as they want
  
### The Complete Python Course
* ![**Book Storage System**](https://github.com/steegea/Book-Storage-System.git)

  * Allows users to:
    * Enter book details (i.e. title and author)
    * Retrieve the list of books they have saved
    * Mark a book as read or not-read (i.e. not finished)
    * Delete a specific book
